        <li><h2> 👑 Priestess Almina – Heart of the City</h2></li>
        <p>At the center of Kardum stood one figure around whom everything revolved — Priestess Almina. She was not only the city’s founder but its soul. Later depictions describe her as tall, cloaked in robes of brown and gold, with a voice quiet yet resonant. She was known not for her physical vision, but for her ability to see into people’s hearts. Her ceremonies blended chanting, meditation, and spiral dancing designed to guide participants into a state of consciousness beyond linear time.</p>

        <li><h2>The Council of Seven – Advisors or Seers?</h2></li>
        <p>Alongside Almina operated a secretive council called “The Seven,” whose members were chosen through their dreams. Anyone who dreamt of the ancient spiral symbol was summoned to the temple for testing. If deemed worthy, they joined the council. They were not rulers in a political sense, but guardians of time — tasked with maintaining balance between past and future, decoding omens, and writing memory scrolls known as “Songs of Forgetting.”</p>

       <li> <h2> The Silent Scribe</h2></li>
        <p>Among the most intriguing figures found in Kardum’s carved texts was one known as “The Silent Scribe.” According to tradition, he never spoke a word. It is said that he took a vow of silence the day he heard his true name — a name believed to cause time itself to unravel if spoken again. His writings took spiral forms, requiring readers to follow them in a circular motion to interpret them. Each piece began with the same phrase: “Memory is not what it was, but what it chooses to be.”</p>

       <li> <h2> A Rift Between Generations</h2></li>
        <p>In Kardum’s second century, tensions grew between the aging Almina and a new generation of her disciples. Some believed the secrets of Kardum should be shared with the outside world, opening its gates to visitors. Almina, however, held that the mysteries of time would be corrupted if exposed to a humanity not yet ready. This rift led to internal divisions that ultimately contributed to the city’s decline. Yet the names of those disciples — and especially Almina — were etched into stone, carried by wind, and kept alive through the story that endured.</p>
