        <li><h2> The Beginning of a Legend</h2></li>
        <p>In 1923, during a routine expedition across the Syrian desert, young British archaeologist Richard Balfour stumbled upon a dusty mound that turned out to be the ruins of an undocumented city. He had no idea then, but he was about to unlock a forgotten chapter of history — the ancient city of Kardum, a name never mentioned in known records, buried beneath layers of sand and time.</p>

        <li><h2>The Essence of the Lost City</h2></li>
        <p>Kardum was no ordinary city. Based on the initial findings — including decorated pottery, mystical symbols etched into stone walls, and inscriptions in ancient Akkadian — it appeared to be a ceremonial center for nomadic tribes. But it was more than a place of ritual. One inscription described it as “The Gate of Time” — a place where humans could experience past and future simultaneously. It wasn't just poetic — it challenged everything we thought we knew about early spiritual life and time perception.</p>

       <li> <h2>The Vision of Priestess Almina</h2></li>
        <p>According to a local legend found in one of the inscriptions, the city was founded by a mysterious priestess named Almina. One night, she dreamed of golden gates opening both skyward and into the desert floor. Interpreting it as a divine message, she gathered followers and led them to the very spot where she would build a city. There, she established a temple where rituals were devoted to memory, dreams, and imagination — the three seasons of time, in her words.</p>
