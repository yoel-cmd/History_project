        <li><h2>  Between Sand and Memory</h2></li>
        <p>When Balfour and his team began excavating Kardum, they weren’t expecting treasures. They looked for walls, inscriptions, traces of culture. But as they dug deeper, the sand began releasing small, stirring items — material fragments of a world that once was. Each artifact told not only its own story but revealed a culture that viewed objects not as tools, but as symbols.</p>

        <li><h2> The Prayer Vessel</h2></li>
        <p>One of the first and most moving discoveries was a small basalt jar etched with spiral symbols. Researchers dubbed it “The Prayer Vessel.” According to later interpretations, priestesses would whisper into the jar, then wrap it in cloth and place it on a sacred shelf. The belief was that the jar “held” the prayer — and sometimes, responded. Similar customs exist among modern tribes, reinforcing the idea of spiritual continuity.</p>

       <li> <h2>The Sound Tablet</h2></li>
        <p>In the main temple, archaeologists found a flat stone slab with carefully measured grooves. Nearby were thin copper reeds. In experimental trials, researchers produced bell-like tones by striking them. Was it a musical instrument? A coded system? Perhaps a ritual device tuned to ancient frequencies? No definitive answer exists — but it’s clear the object was meant to resonate, to move the soul, to bridge man and vibration.</p>

       <li> <h2>The Memory Clock</h2></li>
        <p>Perhaps the most enigmatic find was a round calcite box, semi-transparent, containing seven small spheres, each a different color. When rotated, the spheres followed a fixed path through carved channels, resembling the circular flow of time. On the lid was inscribed: “Not all that moves forward forgets what is behind.” It might be a symbolic clock — not to measure time, but to remember it.</p>

       <li> <h2>Tangible Legacy</h2></li>
        <p>Each artifact found in Kardum became a gate — not only to what was, but to what we choose to remember. These are not mere remains; they are reminders, open questions, voices from the past asking us to listen. They preserve not just data, but emotion. And what is history, if not the union of both?</p>
